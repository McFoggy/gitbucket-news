Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Git platform [GitBucket 4.7](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases/tag/4.7)!

## New permission system

The most impact feature is the new permission system.

We can now give read, write or administration permission to users and groups for each repositories. Also we can add collaborators more flexibly. For example, it's possible to add individual users or other groups to the group repository as the collaborator. And it's also possible to add groups to the personal repository as the collaborator.

In addition, we can also configure which permission of users to allow creating or updating issues or wiki pages.

The filter box is now available in dropdown selection lists. You can filter these lists incrementaly.

Sidebar can be hidden by clicking the hamburger button on the header. Since GitBucket 4.7, hiding status has been kept during a session.
